        "description": "Atlantic Salmon are known to be oily fish with a rich, buttery flavour. To best enjoy the taste of the salmon, we recommend that you simply season it with some salt, pepper and lemon and sear it on a cast iron pan. You can also prepare them with a variety of butter/herb sauces, salsa, dry marinades and more.These steaks are thicker compared to fillets and so are perfect for high-heat cooking methods such as searing, roasting, grilling or broiling. These are bone-in steaks, but the bones can be easily removed before cooking, as per your preference.",
